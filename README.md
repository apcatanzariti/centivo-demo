# Approach
I have worked with Node.js many times in the past, but never MongoDB.
It was interesting to set up a new database and collection, connect to
them and work with them. Got stuck briefly and found out it was due to
the pluralization of the model name, which caused my query to not work.
Eventually found the problem and everything worked. I actually enjoyed
working with MongoDB and would be happy to dive into it further in the
future.
